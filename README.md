# Red-Tailed Hawk Algorithm (RTH)

This study introduces the Red-Tailed Hawk Algorithm (RTH), a new nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization method based on the hunting behaviors of red-tailed hawks. The algorithm mimics the bird’s three-stage hunting strategy to explore and exploit the search space when solving optimization problems.

## Main Steps of the RTH Algorithm

1. **Initialization**  
   Generate an initial population of candidate solutions randomly within the problem’s search space.

2. **High Soaring (Exploration)**  
   Red-tailed hawks explore the search space and identify promising regions where prey (optimal solutions) might exist.

3. **Low Soaring (Exploitation)**  
   The hawks focus their search around the best areas found, refining their positions to get closer to the global optimum.

4. **Stooping and Swooping (Attack/Convergence)**  
   Candidates rapidly converge towards the best solutions, simulating the hawk’s precise swooping attack on its prey.
